Load and compile Shaders
Load and upload meshes to OpenGL
Now we have SHADERS and MESHES, we can create Programs
Create Program, add shaders, 

				
RIGHT NOW**************************************    STATUS
Shader and Program initial classes  				DONE

Watch for changes in project asset 
folder and reimport/compile accordingly				DONE

Implement vertex data for gl_helper 				Working..



LATER++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Camera Object to Render (Perspective Matrix)
	Transform
	

//Cache (imported assets with same directory structure) *** Later
Assets (any asset you want) 
	What'll we do with these? Load into memory, that's what assimp does, no cooking yet
	Import files by extension with Assimp into memory (save their paths, etc)
	Some files you'll be able to change (txt, glsl, etc...)

File Manager
	Expandable File List of Project Folder

Shader Editor
	Save Button + Edit Text

Main View
	Camera can (Select(LMouseClick), Pan(Alt+MMouse), Rotate(Alt+LMouse), Focus(F))
	
	Translate Arrows
	Rotate Arrows
	Scale Arrows

Inspector
	Shows Components of an Object
	Components
		Transform
		Shaders
